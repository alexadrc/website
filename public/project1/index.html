<h3>0 - Introduction:</h3>
<p><em>For the exploratory data analysis project, I have chosen two datasets called “state_info” and “bad_drivers”. Both of these can be found in the “fivethirtyeight” package. The “state_info” dataset is a general overview of the 50 states and the District of Columbia that make up the United States. The dataset consists of the state name, abbreviation, division, and region, designated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Although it sounds like a simple and general dataset, it will be helpful in categorizing the states into regions and divisions for a better overview. The “bad_drivers” dataset also represents statistics about the worst drivers in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The dataset includes the state name, the number of drivers involved in fatal collisions per billion miles, the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collision who were either speeding, alcohol-impaired, not distracted, or who had not been involved in any previous accidents. The dataset also includes the car insurance premiums, in dollars, and the losses incurred by insurance companies for collisions per insured drivers, also in dollars. The dataset is interesting because car accidents are the leading cause of death and the rate continues to increase each year. I wanted to find out if there is a potential association between worst drivers being situated in a particular region in the country that could explain the state in which these are found after fatal collisions.</em></p>

<p><em>The state_info and bad_drivers datasets were already tidy. For the purpose of the project, the datasets were reversed to untidy using the pivot wider function, and then turned back to tidy with the pivor longer function. The function of pivot wider was to make the dataset more wide and broad. The reason why tidy datasets are important is because it makes the data easier to read and simplifies everything into a more simple display.</em></p>

<p><em>Because the two datasets had the common variable of state, which accounted for the 50 US states and DC, the left join function served to join both datasets. The new dataset, state_drivers, was created by merging in order to see the two different data for each state in one. The purpose of this part was to combine the state information, such as division and region, with the state statistics of drivers involved in fatal collisions.</em></p>

<p><em>This part of the project consisted on finding summary statistics about the dataset. Using the filter function, only the south region states were filtered from the data. I then arranged the data by the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were speeding to see what states from the south had the highest percentages in that category. Using the select function, I selected the state name, number of drivers that participated in the study and the percentage of drivers who were alcohol-impaired. I created new variables using the mutate function to turn the percentages into decimals for a futher understanding of the statistics. After this step, I found that Texas had the highest percentage of drivers who speed while Mississippi was the state in the south who reported the lowest percentage. In addition, I created summary statistics for the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were alcohol-impaired using the summarize function to find the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the states by grouping by region. The midwest and northeast regions had the highest average of percentage of drivers who were alcohol impaired while the west and south had lower averages. I repeated the same steps for the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were not distracted by grouping the states into region and division. Statistics show that the west north central division in the midwest region had the highest percentage of drivers who were not distracted while the east south central division in the south region had the lowest. The mean for percentage of drivers who speeding was found for the United States, which resulted in an average of 31.75%. Lastly, a correlation between the number of drivers who participated in the study, percentage of drivers who were alcohol-impaired, and percentage of drivers who were speeding was found using the cor function. Therefore, the correlation between the percentage of drivers who were alcohol-impaired and the ones who were speeding was the strongest.</em></p>

<p><em>Two graphs were made using the ggplot function. The first graph represents the relationship between percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were speeding with car insurance premiums of states by region. I used the color function to separate the states into regions and the label function to label the points with the state names. The geom_point function was able to add the points into the graph for a better visualization. The functions of ggtitle, xlab, and ylab helped the graph by adding a clear title and labels. After analizing the graph, I was able to conclude that states in the midwest had the lowest car insurance premiums and relatively low percentage of speeding. There was not a clear relationship between the two variables in the other regions. The second graph represents the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were speeding and/or alcohol-impaired per region and division. The bar graph was created with the geom_bar function and the stat=“summary” to calculate and graph the correct values for each division. The geom_errorbar function created the whiskers in the bar graph making it a box plot, where it was easier to determine which regions and divisions had outliers. Based on the graph, I was able to conclude that the mid-Atlantic division in the northeast region had the biggest outlier. The pacific division in the west region had the highest percentage of drivers who were speeding and/or alcohol-impaired.</em></p>

<p><em>For the dimensionality reduction part, I conducted a PCA. First, I created a new dataset called state_nums where I grabbed my numeric variables using the select, is.numeric, and scale functions. I then transformed the data into state_pca using the princomp function. I ran the summary function on the new dataset so I could observe and analyze the summary statistics of the PCA, including standard deviation, proportion of variance, and cumulative proportion. I was also able to see the correlation between my numeric variables in each component. In order to decide which PCs to keep, I created a plot of the proportion of variance of each principal component using the eigval, varprop, and ggplot functions. I picked the PCs before the elbow, made sure their cumulative proportion of variance was less than 80%, and whose eigenvalues were greated than 1. I then looked at the summary statistics again to determine the components. I was able to see that higher scores in PC1 represented high percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were alcohol-impaired but scored low on insurance premiums and losses incurred by insurance companies for collisions per insured driver. In PC2, all loadings had similar sign and magnitude, but there was no direct relationship with the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who had not been involved in any previous accidents because all the values were negative except for that one. Lastly, I created a ggplot of PC1 and PC2 to better understand the relationship between the states and numeric variables. I observed that small states like DC, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey, which are mainly part of the northeast, scored low on PC1 and PC2. The west and midwest regions, however, scored relatively high on both PC1 and PC2.</em></p>
