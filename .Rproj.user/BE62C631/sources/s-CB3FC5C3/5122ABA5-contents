## Modeling 

- **0. (Introduction)**

 Pokemon has been apart of our generation offering a wide variety of games and T.V shows for entertainment. A fictitious world containing monsters and battles, motivates each player to capture and train each pokemon.  With each new installment, a new generation of Pokemon are introduced widening the variety of the Pokemon population. This data set contains all the Pokemon up to Generation Six. It contains the maximum points for health, attack, defense, and speed. The dataset also contains the Generation number, Legendary status, color, gender, height(m), and weight(kg). "Type_2" was dropped because we will primarily focus on the "Type_1" of the pokemon. Speed attack and Speed Defense were also dropped since this contains more specific character statistics that we are not concerned with. The Egg groups, Mega Evolution, catch rate, and body style were also dropped since we are focusing on statistics related to the Pokemon and not statistics within the game. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
Pokemon <- read_csv("SDS348_Fall2019/pokemon_alopez247.csv")
Poke <- Pokemon %>% select(-Total,-Sp_Atk,-Sp_Def,-Type_2,-Pr_Male,-Egg_Group_1,-Egg_Group_2, -hasMegaEvolution, -Catch_Rate,-Body_Style)
```


- **1. (MANOVA)**

```{r}
Man1 <- manova(cbind(HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Height_m, Weight_kg)~Type_1, data=Poke)
summary(Man1)
Poke%>%group_by(Type_1)%>%summarize(mean(HP), mean(Attack), mean(Defense), mean(Speed), mean(Height_m), mean(Weight_kg))
pairwise.t.test(Poke$HP,Poke$Type_1,p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(Poke$Attack,Poke$Type_1,p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(Poke$Defense,Poke$Type_1,p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(Poke$Speed,Poke$Type_1,p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(Poke$Height_m,Poke$Type_1,p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(Poke$Weight_kg,Poke$Type_1,p.adj="none"
```


- **2. Randomization Tests**

```{r}

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
